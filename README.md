# ScaleKit

ScaleKit is a comprehensive reference architecture and starter kit for modern, scalable software development. We've packed in more opinions on architecture than a city planning committee has on bike sheds, and we're geared up in full lycra to help you ride the slipstream of practices and technologies pioneered by many big brains before us.

## Purpose

1. **Educational Resource**: Demonstrates real-world implementation of modern programming and architecture principles.
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Provides a foundation for quickly building scalable Proof of Concept (PoC) projects.
3. **Modernization Blueprint**: Serves as a documented target architecture for teams updating their technology stack/practice.

## Key Features

- Scalable across performance, maintainability, reliability, extensibility, and collaboration
- Documented decisions through Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Incorporates Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles

## Technologies and Practices

ScaleKit enables developers to gain hands-on experience with scalable architecture patterns and proven practices in software development.

- Monorepo management (Turborepo)
- Web (Next.js, React) and mobile (React Native) development
- API communication (tRPC, TanStack Query)
- Containerized services
- Database ORM (Prisma)
- Unified design system
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD templates
- Asynchronous job framework and webhooks
- Comprehensive testing suite:
  - Unit testing
  - Integration testing
  - Functional testing
  - Visual testing
- Static code analysis

### Supported Languages

We know that not everyone wants to use JS/TS and that it doesn't reflect the plethora of language large orgs have. We will extend to support GO, PHP, C#, Java, Ruby apps using gRPC for interoperability.
