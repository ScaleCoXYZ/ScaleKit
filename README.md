# ScaleKit

ScaleKit is a comprehensive reference architecture and starter kit for modern, scalable software development.

## Purpose

1. **Educational Resource**: Demonstrates real-world implementation of modern programming and architecture principles.
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Provides a foundation for quickly building scalable Proof of Concept (PoC) projects.
3. **Modernization Blueprint**: Serves as a target architecture for teams updating their technology stack.

## Key Features

- Scalable across performance, maintainability, reliability, extensibility, and collaboration
- Documented decisions through Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Incorporates Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles

## Technologies and Practices

ScaleKit enables developers to gain hands-on experience with scalable architecture patterns and best practices in software development.
